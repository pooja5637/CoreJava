#AutoBoxing
-> Automatic conversion of primitive to wrapper object by compiler is called autoboxing.

-> Integer I = 10 ; compiler converts int to Integer automatically by autoboxing.

-> After compilation the above line will become, Integer I = Integer.valueOf(10);
	i.e. internally autoboxing concept is implemented by using valueOf().
	
#AutoUnboxing

-> Automatic conversion of wrapper object to primitive by compiler is called autounboxing.

-> Integer I = new Integer(10);
   int i = I; [Compiler converts Integer to int automatically by autounboxing]
   
  -> after compilation the above line will become, int i = I.intValue();
  i.e. internally autounboxing concept is implemented by using xxxValue().

 Primtive -> Wrapper ==> Autoboxing [valueOf()]
 Wrapper -> Primitive ==> AutoUnboxing [xxxValue()]
